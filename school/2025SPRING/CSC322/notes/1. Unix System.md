1. **What are the two main lines of UNIX development?**
    
    - The two main lines of UNIX development are the AT&T UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).​[cs.miami.edu](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/schulz/CSC322.pdf)
2. **What is the advantage of having most of UNIX written in C?**
    
    - Writing UNIX in C enhances its portability across different hardware architectures.​
3. **To what standard should programs be written to ensure portability between UNIX variants?**
    
    - Programs should adhere to the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard to ensure portability between UNIX variants.​
4. - **How is the information about each UNIX user stored?**
    
    - Information about each UNIX user is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file, with each line corresponding to a user.​
5. **What seven items of information are stored about each user of a UNIX system?**
    
    - Each user entry in `/etc/passwd` includes: username, password, UID, GID (primary group ID), personal information, home directory, and shell program.​
6. **What file contains the information about users in a non-NIS based UNIX system?**
    - In a non-NIS based UNIX system, user information is contained in the `/etc/passwd` file.​
    
7. **What command lists the users in an NIS based UNIX system?**
    
    - In an NIS-based UNIX system, the `ypcat passwd` command lists the users.
    ​
8.  **What UID does the super-user have?**
    
    - The super-user has a UID of 0.​
9.  **What does the `who` command do?**
    
    - The `who` command displays a list of users currently logged into the system.​
10. **What command shows the groups of the owner of the process?**
    
    - The `id` command shows the groups associated with the current user, who is the owner of the process.​
11. **Define a process.**
    
    - A process is an instance of a running program.​
    
12. **How is the first process on a UNIX system created, and what is it (eventually) called?**
    
    - The first process is created during system boot and is eventually called `init`.​
13. **What is the name of the important process whose PID is 1?**
    
    - The process with PID 1 is named `init`.
14. **What do the `getty` processes do?**
    
    - `getty` processes manage terminal lines, handling login prompts and initiating user sessions.
15. **What does the `pwd` command do?**
    
    - The `pwd` command displays the current working directory.
16. **What does the `cd` command do?**
    
    - The `cd` command changes the current working directory.
17. **Explain what the UID and EUID of a process are used for.**
    
    - The UID determines a process's access permissions, while the EUID is used for effective privilege checks, allowing temporary elevated rights.
18. **What does the `id` command tell?**
    
    - The `id` command displays the user and group information for the current user.
19.  **What would the command `kill -9 90210` do?**
    
    - The command `kill -9 90210` forcefully terminates the process with PID 90210.
20.  **What are environment variables?**
    
    - Environment variables are dynamic values that affect the behavior of processes on a system.
    
21. **What commands display, set, and remove environment variables?**
    
    - The `printenv` or `env` commands display environment variables; `export` sets them; and `unset` removes them.
    
22.  **What does the command `man man` provide?**
    
    - The command `man man` provides the manual page for the `man` command itself.
    
23.  **What two files in your home directory are read by your shell when you login?**
    
    - The shell reads `~/.tcshrc` (or `~/.cshrc` if `~/.tcshrc` is absent) and `~/.login` upon login.​
    
24.  **Give the command to set a shell variable named `NewPath` to the current value of the `path` variable.**
    
    - `set NewPath = ($path)`​
    
25. **List in order the places that a shell checks for the code to execute a user's command.**
    
    - The shell first performs alias substitution, then variable substitution, followed by globbing, checks for built-in commands, and if not found, searches directories listed in the `path` variable.​
    
26. **Explain how to make a shell script into a standalone executable.**
    
    - Add `#!/bin/tcsh` at the beginning of the script and set the execute permission using `chmod +x scriptname`.​
    
27.  **Explain the effect of putting the following lines in your `.tcshrc` file:**
    
    - `alias vi vim`​
        
    - `alias pico vi`
        
    - These aliases make the `vi` command invoke `vim`, and the `pico` command invoke `vi` (which, due to the first alias, actually runs `vim`).​
        
28.  **Explain the underlying mechanism that causes a command such as `ls -la | grep System` to send the output from `ls` to the input of `grep`.**
    
    - The pipe (`|`) connects the `stdout` of `ls` to the `stdin` of `grep`, allowing the output of `ls` to be directly used as input for `grep`.​
29. **Explain the difference between placing a string in single and double quotes in a command.**
    
    - Single quotes (`'`) prevent all variable substitution and special character interpretation, while double quotes (`"`) allow variable substitution but prevent globbing and word splitting.
30. **How is it possible for a program to read a network connection as a file?**
    
    - In UNIX, network connections are treated as socket link files, allowing programs to read from them as they would from regular files.​\
31. **Explain the mechanism by which multiple physical disk partitions are viewed as a single file system in UNIX.**
    
    - UNIX achieves this by mounting different file systems onto directories within a single hierarchical tree structure, integrating multiple partitions seamlessly.​
32. **What is the significance of a leading `.` on a file name?**
    
    - A leading `.` makes the file hidden, so it isn't displayed by default with standard `ls` commands.
33. **Which of the following are legal file names in UNIX?**
    
    1. `big_222_numbers` - Legal​
    2. `.HiddenCode.c` - Legal​
    3. `spaced out man` - Legal​
    4. `/slash/` - Illegal, as `/` is a directory separator
    5. `$dollar$` - Legal​
    6. `I'm a little Noddy Man, I always nod my head` - Legal​
34. **Describe how hard links give a file multiple names in UNIX.**
    
    - Hard links allow multiple directory entries to reference the same inode, enabling a single file to have multiple names across the file system.​
    
35. **Describe how soft (symbolic) links give a file multiple names in UNIX.**
    
    - Symbolic links are special files that point to another file or directory by path, providing alternative names or paths to the target.​
36. **Describe what users can do to the file `MyProgram` after executing the command `chmod 510 MyProgram`.**
    
    - The owner can read and execute the file; the group has execute-only permission; others have no access.​
37. **Describe what users can do to the directory `PartialSecrets` after executing the command `chmod 754 PartialSecrets`.**
    
    - The owner has full read, write, and execute permissions; the group can read and execute; others can only read the directory contents.​
38. **Give a command that adds read and write permission to the file `NoSecrets` for the group and others.**
    
    - `chmod go+rw NoSecrets`
39. **At a command prompt, what would the following commands do: `!17` and `!gli`?**
    
    - `!17` re-executes the command numbered 17 in the history list, while `!gli` re-executes the most recent command starting with 'gli'.​
    
40. **In globbing, what do the `*` and `?` characters designate?**
    
    - In globbing, `*` matches any string (including empty), and `?` matches any single character.​
41. **Explain the difference between a background process and the foreground process.**
    
    - A foreground process runs interactively, occupying the shell until completion, whereas a background process runs concurrently, allowing continued shell use.​
42. **Explain the difference between these two commands: `ls & ps & date &` and `ls ; ps ; date`.**
    
    - `ls & ps & date &` executes all three commands concurrently in the background, while `ls ; ps ; date` executes them sequentially in the foreground.​
43. **What does the following command output: `find / -empty | wc -w`?**
    
    - This command outputs the word count of empty files and directories found from the root directory.​
44. **Which of the following lines are recognized by the regexp `^a*b+c{2}`?**
    
    - The lines `abbccc` and `aaabbbccc` match the regular expression `^a*b+c{2}`
