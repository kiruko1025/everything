- **What are the four main stages of the C compilation process?**
    
    - The four main stages are preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking.​
- **What is the role of the preprocessor in the compilation process?**
    
    - The preprocessor handles directives like `#include` and `#define`, and removes comments from the source code.​[cs.miami.edu](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/wuchtys/CSC322-25S/Content/CTools/Preprocessor.shtml)
- **Which compiler option stops the process after the preprocessing stage?**
    
    - The `-E` option stops the compiler after the preprocessing stage.​[cs.miami.edu](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/wuchtys/CSC322-25S/Content/CTools/Preprocessor.shtml)
- **What does the `-S` compiler option do?**
    
    - The `-S` option instructs the compiler to generate assembly code and stop, producing a `.s` file.​
- **How can you generate an object file without linking?**
    
    - Use the `-c` compiler option to compile source code into an object file without linking.​
- **What is the purpose of the `-o` compiler option?**
    
    - The `-o` option specifies the name of the output file.​
- **Which option enables all compiler warnings?**
    
    - The `-Wall` option enables all compiler warnings.​
- **How do you include additional directories for header file searches?**
    
    - Use the `-I` option followed by the directory path to add directories for header file searches.​
- **What is the function of the `-l` compiler option?**
    
    - The `-l` option links with a specified library during compilation.​
- **How can you define a macro from the command line during compilation?**
    
    - Use the `-D` option followed by the macro definition to define a macro from the command line.
- **Explain the difference between `#include <blue.h>` and `#include "blue.h"`?**
    
    - `#include <blue.h>` searches for the header file in the system's standard include directories, while `#include "blue.h"` first searches in the directory of the source file and then in the standard directories.​
- **Write a program that prints out the date and time it was compiled.**
    
    - Utilize the predefined macros `__DATE__` and `__TIME__` to print the compilation date and time:​
        
        c
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `#include <stdio.h>  int main() {     printf("Compiled on: %s at %s\n", __DATE__, __TIME__);     return 0; }`
        
- **What does the following macro do? `#define cc(A,B,C) (A)?(B):(C)`**
    
    - The macro `cc(A,B,C)` evaluates the condition `A`; if true, it returns `B`, otherwise it returns `C`, effectively implementing a ternary conditional operator.​
- **Write a conditional compilation statement that includes code only if the symbol `DEBUG` is defined.**
    
    - Use the `#ifdef` directive to include code conditionally:
        
        c
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `#ifdef DEBUG     // Debug-specific code here #endif`
- **What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a variable or function?**
    
    - A declaration specifies the type and name of a variable or function without allocating storage, while a definition allocates storage or provides the function's implementation.
- **Give the syntax for a function declaration.**
    
    - `<return_type> <function_name>(<parameter_list>);`​
- **Give the syntax for a function definition.**
    
    - `<return_type> <function_name>(<parameter_list>) { <local_variables> <statements> [return [<expression>]] }`​
- **How are arrays treated differently from other variables when passed as arguments to functions?**
    
    - Arrays are passed by reference, meaning the function receives the address of the first element, whereas other variables are passed by value.​
- **What effect does the `const` qualifier have when applied to a function argument?**
    
    - The `const` qualifier prevents the function from modifying the value of the argument within its scope.​
- **What is the difference between `*i1` in the following two lines?**
    

    
    `int *i1; *i1 = 27;`
    
    - In the first line, `*i1` declares `i1` as a pointer to an integer, whereas in the second line, `*i1 = 27;` attempts to assign the value `27` to the integer pointed to by `i1`, which may lead to undefined behavior if `i1` is uninitialized.​
- **What does the `&` operator return when applied to a variable?**
    
    - The `&` operator returns the memory address of the variable to which it is applied.​
- **What is the output from the following code?**
    
    c
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `int data[] = {8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}; int *bean;  bean = &data[3]; printf("%d %ld\n", bean[data[6]], &data[5] - bean);`
    
    - The output is `4 2`, since `bean[data[6]]` accesses `data[5]` which is `4`, and `&data[5] - bean` calculates the difference in positions between `data[5]` and `bean`, resulting in `2`.​
- **Given the multidimensional array `float values[4][3];`, what is the equivalent pointer expression for `values[2][2]`?**
    
    - The equivalent pointer expression is `*(*(values + 2) + 2)`.​
- **What errors might the following code produce?**
    
    c
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `char string[128]; char *name;  strcpy(string, name); strcpy(name, "old stuff");`
    
    - The code may produce errors because `name` is an uninitialized pointer, leading to undefined behavior when used as a source in `strcpy` and as a destination in the second `strcpy`.​
- **Give an example showing how an array of pointers can be used to create a two-dimensional array in which the rows are of differing lengths.**
    
    - An example is:
        
        c
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `int *array[3]; array[0] = malloc(2 * sizeof(int)); // Row 0 with 2 elements array[1] = malloc(3 * sizeof(int)); // Row 1 with 3 elements array[2] = malloc(4 * sizeof(int)); // Row 2 with 4 elements`
        
        Here, `array` is an array of pointers, each pointing to a dynamically allocated array of integers of varying lengths.
        
- **Give `typedef`s to define a data type for an array of three pointers to functions, where each function takes two `int` arguments and returns a `float`.**
    
    - An example is:
        
        
        `typedef float (*func_ptr)(int, int); func_ptr func_array[3];`
        
        This defines `func_ptr` as a pointer to a function that takes two `int` arguments and returns a `float`, and `func_array` as an array of three such pointers.
        
- **Write a program that takes integers as command line arguments, sums them, and returns the sum back to the operating system.**
    
    - An example program is:

        
        `#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     int sum = 0;     for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {         sum += atoi(argv[i]);     }     printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);     return sum; }`
        
        This program converts command-line arguments to integers, sums them, prints the result, and returns the sum as the exit status.
- **What are the basic arithmetic operators in C, and what is their precedence?**
    
    - The basic arithmetic operators in C are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`, with multiplication, division, and modulus (`*`, `/`, `%`) having higher precedence than addition and subtraction (`+`, `-`).​
- **How do relational and logical operators differ in C?**
    
    - Relational operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) compare values and return true or false, while logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) combine or invert boolean expressions.​
- **What is the function of the bitwise AND operator, and how is it commonly used?**
    
    - The bitwise AND operator (`&`) performs a bit-by-bit AND operation between two integers and is commonly used for masking specific bits.​
- **Explain the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the increment operator in C.**
    
    - In the prefix form (`++i`), the variable is incremented before its value is used in an expression; in the postfix form (`i++`), the variable's current value is used before it is incremented.​
- **What does the conditional (ternary) operator `?:` do in C?**
    
    - The conditional operator evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false, in the form `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`.​
- **How does the comma operator function in C expressions?**
    
    - The comma operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in sequence, returning the value of the rightmost expression.​
- **What is the purpose of the `sizeof` operator in C?**
    
    - The `sizeof` operator returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or object.​
- **Describe how the bitwise shift operators (`<<` and `>>`) work in C.**
    
    - The left shift operator (`<<`) shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros, effectively multiplying by powers of two; the right shift operator (`>>`) shifts bits to the right, with the fill behavior depending on the system and whether the value is signed or unsigned.​
- **What is the result of using the logical negation operator `!` on a non-zero integer in C?**
    
    - Applying the logical negation operator `!` to a non-zero integer results in `0` (false).​
- **How can you ensure a specific order of evaluation in complex C expressions?**
    
    - To ensure a specific order of evaluation, use parentheses to explicitly define the desired order.
- **Write a program that declares an array of 10 pointers to `char`, then reads 10 lines from the user, dynamically allocates enough memory for each line after it is read, and makes successive members of the array point to the dynamically allocated memory. When done, the program must then release all the dynamically allocated memory.**
    
    - This program involves creating an array of 10 `char` pointers, using `malloc` to allocate memory for each line input by the user, assigning each pointer to the allocated memory, and finally using `free` to release the allocated memory.​
- **Explain what `realloc` does, including the cases when the new size does not equal the old size.**
    
    - The `realloc` function adjusts the size of a previously allocated memory block, preserving its contents; if the new size is larger, the additional memory is uninitialized, and if smaller, the excess memory is freed.​
- **Explain the difference between `memcpy` and `memmove`.**
    
    - Both `memcpy` and `memmove` copy bytes between memory areas, but `memmove` safely handles overlapping regions by ensuring the original data is preserved during the copy process, whereas `memcpy` does not guarantee correct behavior for overlapping memory areas.
