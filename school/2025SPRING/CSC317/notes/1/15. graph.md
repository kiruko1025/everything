## Graph representation
matrix 
list
table
![[Pasted image 20250427183247.png]]
## BFS
$O(n+m)$

## DFS
$O(n+m)$

### Types of edges
tree edge (white)
back edge (grey)
forward edge (black)
cross edge (black)

## Topological sorting
only works on DAG(directed acyclic graph (no back edge))

## Strongly connected component 
Transpose graph - for a directed graph all directions of edge are reversed

# MST
## Kruskal
minimum weight edge first
![[Pasted image 20250427192215.png]]

## Prim
nearest node first

# SP
a graph with negative cycle has no SP

## Dijkstra 
non-negative edges
## Floyd-Warshall
