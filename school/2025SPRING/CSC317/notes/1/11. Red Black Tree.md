13.1 - 13.2

## Properties
1. Every node is B or R
2. Root is B
3. NIL is B
4. If a node is R then both children are B
5. For each node all path from the node to descendant leaves has same # of B nodes $bh(x)$

   Lemma
   Height of red black tree with n node is at most $2\log{(n+1)}$

## Rotations

## Insertion 
Insert new node $N$ like regular binary search tree and color node red
Call fix function that loops the following:
case 1: no rule violation - done

case 2: If $N$ is root 
1.  turn it to black

case 3: $N$ 's uncle is red 
1. turn $N.p$  and uncle to black
2. $N.p.p$ red
3.  set $N=N.g$ 

case 4: $N$'s uncle is black
case 4.1: LL 
1. right rotate on $N.g$
2. recolor $N.p$ and $N.g$

case 4.2: LR
3. left rotation on $N.p$
4. go to case 4.1

case 4.3: RR
1. left rotate on $N.g$
2. recolor $N.p$ and $N.g$

case 4.4: RL
1. right rotate on $N.p$
2. go to case 4.3
